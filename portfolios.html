            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions — Portfolios (UMSI)</h2>

            <p>
                These FAQs are tailored for UMSI students preparing portfolios for internships, full-time roles, and
                academic presentations.
                For personalized guidance, schedule a portfolio review with the UMSI Career Development Office.
            </p>

            <div>
                <h3>How many projects should I include?</h3>
                <p>
                    Include <strong>3–6 in-depth case studies</strong> that demonstrate both breadth and depth.
                    You may also showcase smaller projects on a “Selected Work” page, but always prioritize quality and
                    clarity over quantity.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>What should each case study contain?</h3>
                <p>
                    Structure your case studies using this flow:
                    <strong>Context / Problem → Your Role → Process → Deliverables → Outcomes</strong>.
                    Use visuals, prototypes, and measurable results wherever possible to make your impact clear.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>How do I present group projects?</h3>
                <p>
                    Always highlight your <strong>specific contributions</strong> within the team.
                    You can list your role, showcase artifacts you created, or link to individual deliverables if
                    possible.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Can I include work from internships or employers?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, but only with permission. If approval isn’t possible, remove sensitive details and anonymize
                    the data.
                    Alternatively, create a reconstructed version using placeholder content and clarify this in your
                    write-up.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Website portfolio vs PDF — which should I use?</h3>
                <p>
                    Use both when possible:
                    a <strong>website</strong> for visibility and a concise <strong>PDF one-pager</strong> for
                    recruiters who need quick access.
                    Make sure the website is responsive and the PDF is scannable.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>How do I include code, data, or notebooks?</h3>
                <p>
                    Link to a <strong>well-documented GitHub repository</strong> with a README summarizing your project.
                    For notebooks, share a rendered version (e.g., HTML or PDF) and highlight key findings or
                    visualizations.
                    Avoid uploading large raw datasets — link to external repositories instead.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>What file formats and image guidelines should I follow?</h3>
                <p>
                    Use compressed but high-quality images (<strong>JPEG/PNG</strong> for photos, <strong>SVG</strong>
                    for icons).
                    Always include descriptive <code>alt</code> text for accessibility, such as:
                    <em>"Low-fidelity wireframes showing dashboard filters (student role: interaction design)"</em>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>How long should a case study be?</h3>
                <p>
                    Keep each case study between <strong>300–800 words</strong>, supplemented with visuals.
                    Start with a short summary and include a “What I did” section for quick scanning.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>How can I make my portfolio accessible?</h3>
                <p>
                    Use descriptive <code>alt</code> text, captions for videos, transcripts for demos, and clear heading
                    structures.
                    Test your portfolio with a screen reader to ensure a smooth experience for all users.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>How can I get feedback on my portfolio?</h3>
                <p>
                    Schedule a review with the <strong>UMSI Career Development Office</strong> or participate in
                    portfolio critique sessions.
                    You can also request peer feedback from classmates and alumni.

                <h3>Should I include coursework or publications?</h3>
                <p>
                    Include them if they’re relevant to your career goals.
                    Summarize key learnings or results rather than uploading full transcripts.
                    For publications, provide links or DOIs wherever possible.

                <h3>How do I prepare to present my portfolio during interviews?</h3>
                <p>
                    Be ready with a <strong>60–90 second summary</strong> for each project.
                    Keep a short demo video or local backup of your work in case online links fail,
                    and bring a one-page PDF summary for sharing.
